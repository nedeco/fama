 Fama is a software solution designed to bridge weather sensor data with home automation systems. Currently focused on the city of Solingen, Fama is designed to receive data from RabbitMQ, process it, and format it for seamless integration with various supported home systems.

 ## Features
 - **Weather Data Integration:** Connects to RabbitMQ to receive real-time weather sensor data.
 - **Home Automation Support:** Formats and forwards data to:
    - **Home Assistant** (including systems compatible with Home Assistant's format and autodiscovery, such as OpenHAB).
    - **ioBroker** via its API.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Easily adaptable to other cities or systems in the future.

## Supported Systems

### Home Assistant and OpenHAB

Fama uses MQTT to publish weather sensor data in Home Assistant's autodiscovery format. This allows:

- Easy integration with Home Assistant.

- Compatibility with OpenHAB when configured to use Home Assistant-formatted data.

See the [guide on connecting Fama to Home Assistant.](/documentation/homesystem/HOMEASSISTANT.md)

See the [guide on connecting Fama to OpenHAB](/documentation/homesystem/OPENHAB.md).

### ioBroker

Fama integrates with ioBroker via the REST-API Adapter, enabling direct communication for weather sensor data management.
