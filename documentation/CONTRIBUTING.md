# Contributing

We value contributions from the community! To maintain project quality and ensure smooth collaboration, please follow the guidelines below when contributing.
If you have ideas or want to add support for other systems, please submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Prerequisites
- **Home System:** Ensure you have access to a running home system like Home Assistant, OpenHAB, or ioBroker. These systems are required to test Fama's integration and functionality.

## Installation
1. Fork this repository on GitHub. For detailed instructions, refer to the [GitHub guide on forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

2. Configure the application:
    - Copy and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`, then update the file with the desired settings. These are critical for connecting Fama to your home system.
    - Update the RabbitMQ connection settings in the configuration file.
    - Update the MQTT or ioBroker API settings as needed.
    - Ensure that all required dependencies like [Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/#java21) are installed and your environment meets the prerequisites before building and running the application.

3. Build and run the application:
```bash
./gradle_env.sh run
```


## Configuration
Fama uses a configuration file to manage its settings. The following parameters must be set:

**RabbitMQ Settings.**

- **RABBIT_MQ_STOMP_URL:** RabbitMQ STOMP server address.
    
    For development purposes you can use this:
    ```
    wss://digitaltwin.service.nedeco.digital:15673/ws
    ```

- **RABBIT_MQ_STOMP_USERNAME:** RabbitMQ username.
    
    For development purposes you can use this:
    ```
    smart-home
    ```

- **RABBIT_MQ_STOMP_PASSWORD:** Password for the user.
    
    For development purposes you can use this:
    ```

    ```

- **SMART_HOME_TYPE:** Type of home system.
    - **HA** for Home Assistant and OpenHAB
    - **IB** for ioBroker
- **Home Assistant/OpenHAB specific:**
  - **MQTT_USERNAME:** Username to connect to Fama's MQTT.
  - **MQTT_PASSWORD:** Password
- **ioBroker specific:**
  - **IO_BROKER_URL:** ioBroker's REST API url.


## Connecting with home system

See the following documentation on how to set up a home system of choice with Fama.

Start the appropriate Docker container for your home system using the commands below. Ensure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/) is installed and running on your system.

Start Docker with your selected home system using one of the predefined configurations in the [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) file.

- **Home Assistant:** 
    ```
    docker compose run homeassistant
    ```
    See the documentation on how to [connect Home Assistant to Fama](/documentation/homesystem/HOMEASSISTANT.md)

- **OpenHAB:** 
    ```
    docker compose run openhab
    ```
    See the documentation on how to [connect OpenHAB to Fama](/documentation/homesystem/OPENHAB.md)

- **ioBroker:** 
    ```
    docker compose run iobroker
    ```
    See the documentation on how to [connect ioBroker to Fama](/documentation/homesystem/IOBROKER.md)

5. **Code Review**:  
   Contributors who take ownership of features or modules are expected to:
    - Respond to issues and questions related to their contributions.
    - Update their code to align with future project requirements." 

6. **Follow the Coding Style**:  
   - Use the same coding style and conventions as the existing codebase.  

## Code Ownership  

To maintain accountability and ensure high-quality contributions:  

- **Feature/Module Ownership**:  
   - Contributors who submit significant changes or new features may be asked to take ownership of that part of the codebase. This means:  
     - Helping maintain it over time.  
     - Addressing issues and questions related to it.  
     - Updating or improving it as needed.  

- **Collaborative Ownership**:  
   - Code ownership is shared among the community. While specific contributors may lead certain areas, everyone is encouraged to review and contribute to all parts of the project.
